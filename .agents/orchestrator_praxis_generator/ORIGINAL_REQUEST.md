Upgrade the `~/praxis` boilerplate generator by integrating architectural insights from the Chatman ecosystem (`rocket-craft`, `lsp-max`, and generative typestates). Catalog each Rust library to identify abstractions and components that can be extracted and contributed to the upgraded generator, and apply these upgrades to the codebase.

Working directory: `~/praxis`
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. Ecosystem Catalog and Abstraction
Catalog the Rust libraries in the `~/rocket-craft` and `~/lsp-max` workspaces. Identify and document architectural patterns, abstractions, and components (such as Generative Typestates, `RulePackServer`, and the `ggen` µ-pipeline) that can be abstracted and contributed to the `praxis` generator.

### R2. Praxis Generator Upgrade
Upgrade the `~/praxis` boilerplate generator codebase. The upgraded generator must produce boilerplate that natively implements the "Post-Chatman Equation" ($A = \mu(O^*)$) ecosystem insights, specifically targeting the emission of typestate-driven configurations and `RulePackServer` structures over manual scaffolding.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Documentation
- [ ] A comprehensive Markdown catalog exists detailing the analyzed Rust libraries, extracted abstractions, and integration strategies.

### Implementation & Verification
- [ ] The `~/praxis` codebase contains the implemented Rust code upgrades.
- [ ] Executing the upgraded `praxis` generator successfully emits a sample boilerplate project.
- [ ] The emitted sample project successfully compiles (`cargo check` passes).
- [ ] A programmatic verification script confirms the emitted project structurally conforms to Post-Chatman principles (e.g., detects `PhantomData` typestates or `RulePackServer` implementations).
